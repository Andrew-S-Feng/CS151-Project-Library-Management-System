CS-151 Project - Using JavaSE-1.8 & JUnit 4

My laptop got corrupted yesterday, and unfortunately I lost almost all my work on my project.
What I currently have is pretty much all I could cobble together over 26 hours.

The GUI is half finished, orginally it was supposed to have two sections for books, one for books in stock and one for checked out books.
It was also supposed to dectect when an admin logged in and give a choice between book database and user database.

There are two sample text files, "Books" and "Users.txt" included in the repository.
